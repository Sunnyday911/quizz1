                        <p>Kue lumpur is a traditional Indonesian cake known for its soft and moist texture. 
                            The name “kue lumpur” translates to “mud cake,” but don’t let that fool you. It’s a delicious treat! This cake is typically made from a mixture of mashed potatoes, flour, sugar, eggs, and coconut milk. 
                            The batter is often flavored with vanilla and sometimes pandan, giving it a fragrant aroma.
                            The cake is usually cooked in small, round molds and topped with raisins or slices of young coconut. The result is a rich, creamy cake with a slightly custard-like consistency. Kue lumpur is a popular snack and is often enjoyed with a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
