                    The history of Sidoarjo dates back centuries and is rich with cultural influences. Originally, the area was inhabited by the indigenous Madurese and Javanese people. Over time, due to its strategic location along key trade routes, Sidoarjo became a melting pot of various traditions and cultures1.
In the mid-19th century, Sidoarjo was known as Sidokare and was part of Surabaya. It was led by a regent named R. NG. Djoyohardjo. In 1859, Sidokare separated from Surabaya and became its own regency, eventually changing its name to Sidoarjo23.
Sidoarjo also played a significant role during the Majapahit era, which was one of the greatest and most powerful empires in Southeast Asia. The regionâ€™s historical significance continued into modern times, particularly with the Lapindo mudflow disaster in 2006, which has had a lasting impact on the area.
